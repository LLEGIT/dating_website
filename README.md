# my_meetic
My_meetic is a school project which goal was to recreate a dating website, using HTML, CSS, PHP in PDO OOP and SQL.<br/>
The different php pages each represent a functionnality of the website (create account, connect, search users).<br/>
I store the passwords with the php encrypt function, PASSWORD_DEFAULT method.<br/>
The sql file for the db structure is given in the repo.<br/>
The project must be executed in a localhost to work (Apache2, ...)
